This project seeks to control industrial systems such as
 motor and other systems using gestures.
 Libraries used were:
                    opencv-python
                    mediapipe
                    time

The on and off state of the system can be changed with
high five and a clinched fist respectively.

Components used for the project:
                                Arduino Uno
                                Relay
                                Motor(220V)
                                Leds(red and green)
                                jumper wires
                                bread board.
